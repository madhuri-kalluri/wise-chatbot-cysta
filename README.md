# wise-chatbot-cysta
This project was a webapp using C# and Microsoft Azure in order to implement a chatbot which can converse with a user to help them find new books for reading based on the genre they like or the author they want to read or based on the previous descriptions.

This project was done by Sravani Baswaraj, Shweta Yerram and me. So I imported this project repository from Sravani Baswaraj
